# DCS-UB-e-AHK-scripts
*(DISCONTINUED)*
*Dorami's Community Server UnbelivaBoat economy AutoHotkey scripts*

There are some simple AHK scripts i made for dcs's economy bot because i was bored to type the same shid over and over again.

You can download the zip file and run one of the compiled scripts in \exefiles by clicking on the discord's textbar and then pressing "0" on your keyboard.

*To stop the script just go on your taskbar right-click on the script's icon and press "Exit".*

*(I DO NOT RECCOMEND RUNNING ALL THE SCRIPTS AT THE SAME TIME)*
